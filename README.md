# 🛡️ Phishing Attack Investigation — Hands-On Lab

This project is a hands-on exploration of phishing attack investigation techniques. I built a simulated lab environment to safely analyze real-world phishing emails, inspect email headers, investigate suspicious links, and compile a structured incident report.

## 🔍 Key Features

- ⚙️ Simulated email environment using **MailCatcher**
- 📩 Analysis of phishing email samples from public sources
- 🛠️ Use of industry tools like **Thunderbird**, **PhishTool**, and **VirusTotal**
- 🧪 Exercises in:
  - Identifying phishing indicators
  - Analyzing full email headers
  - Investigating suspicious links using sandboxed tools
- 📄 Final report with executive summary, technical analysis, and mitigation recommendations

## 🧠 Project Goal

To build and demonstrate practical skills in recognizing, analyzing, and documenting phishing threats — essential capabilities for roles in security operations and incident response.

## 🛠️ Tools & Resources Used

- [Thunderbird](https://www.thunderbird.net/) — email client for header and message analysis  
- [MailCatcher](https://mailcatcher.me/) — lightweight email server for capturing messages  
- [Swaks](https://github.com/jetmore/swaks?tab=readme-ov-file) — SMTP testing tool  
- [PhishTool](https://phishtool.com/) — phishing analysis and investigation platform  
- [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/) — URL and file scanning sandbox
