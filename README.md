# 🛡️ Phishing Attack Investigation — Hands-On Lab

This project is a hands-on exploration of phishing attack investigation techniques. I set up a local lab environment to safely analyze real phishing emails, inspect headers, investigate suspicious links, and compile a detailed incident report.

## 🔍 Key Features

- Simulated email environment using **MailCatcher**
- Analysis of phishing email samples from **PhishTank** and **OpenPhish**
- Use of tools like **Thunderbird**, **PhishTool**, and **VirusTotal**
- Exercises in:
  - Identifying phishing indicators
  - Analyzing email headers
  - Investigating suspicious links
- Final structured report with recommendations

## 🧠 Purpose
