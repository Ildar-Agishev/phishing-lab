# 🔍 Phishing Attack Investigation – A Hands-On Security Lab

**Phishing** remains one of the most common and dangerous threats in the cybersecurity landscape. As part of my preparation for a role as a **Security Analyst**, I developed a hands-on phishing investigation lab to simulate real-world incident analysis. This blog-style post walks through the project’s stages and insights gained during the process.

## 🧪 Why This Lab?

The goal of this project was to practice **realistic techniques for phishing detection and analysis**, including:

- Identifying phishing characteristics
- Analyzing email headers
- Investigating suspicious links
- Documenting findings professionally

This is not a theory-based exercise — it simulates the type of work one might do in a SOC or during an actual incident response.

## 📌 Project Stages

### 1. Environment Setup

The first step was to establish a **safe, isolated lab environment** using:

- **MailCatcher** – a lightweight SMTP server that captures test emails
- **Thunderbird** – a reliable email client with header inspection support

> MailCatcher was used optionally in this lab to verify email reception and test Thunderbird configuration. If you're generating phishing emails yourself, isolating the environment is **mandatory** to avoid system compromise.

**Goal:** Create a safe workspace to analyze malicious content without risk.

### 2. Collecting Phishing Samples

I imported real phishing email samples sourced from public databases such as:

- [PhishTank](https://www.phishtank.com/)
- [OpenPhish](https://openphish.com/)

These messages were loaded into Thunderbird for inspection.

**Goal:** Work with actual phishing examples for realistic analysis.

### 3. Identifying Phishing Indicators

Each email was reviewed for common phishing signs:

- Fake or spoofed sender addresses  
- Generic greetings (“Dear user”)  
- Urgent language or threats  
- Obfuscated or shortened links

**Goal:** Build awareness of how phishing attempts are crafted.

---

### 4. Email Header Analysis

Using Thunderbird and tools like [EmailHeaders.net](https://emailheaders.net/), I examined raw headers to trace:

- Email routing paths (Received headers)  
- Sender IP addresses  
- Domain mismatch and SPF/DKIM failures

**Goal:** Uncover technical clues that reveal spoofing or forged origins.

---

### 5. Link Investigation

URLs found in the emails were extracted and analyzed using:

- [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/)  
- [PhishTool](https://phishtool.com/)

These tools help determine whether a link points to a malicious or deceptive site, without visiting it directly.

**Goal:** Identify potentially harmful destinations safely.

---

### 6. Report Writing

All findings were compiled into a **structured incident report**, including:

- 📝 Executive summary  
- ⚠️ Observed phishing indicators  
- 🧠 Technical analysis results  
- ✅ Recommendations for prevention

> This report simulates how investigations are documented in real-world cybersecurity teams.

---

## 🚀 Outcomes & Learnings

- Strengthened skills in **email forensics** and header analysis  
- Gained experience using open-source investigation tools  
- Practiced documenting an incident in a structured, readable format  
- Built a valuable portfolio project for job applications

---

This lab not only reinforced core technical skills but also demonstrated my ability to think critically, investigate safely, and communicate findings clearly — all essential for a cybersecurity role.
